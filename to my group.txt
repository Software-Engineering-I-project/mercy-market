extract the contents of folders.zip. then put all contents of this repository on a folder. open folder on vscode and install the "live server" extension on vscode. right click on index.html and click on "open with live server". feel free to change what needs to be change and add features necessary to complete the project. I already did what I could. I tried hosting the site using node.js but I still have technical problems. an alternative was to use XAMPP wich includes PHP, mysql, apache and other tools for web development and hosting. 

(or just open the index.html file on your browser. if it does not load as intended just follow the instructions above)

notes:

 on "our blogs" section, it was able to take you to the link of mercy events but due to some changes on the code it no longer works.

add to cart fucntion works clunky. it adds items to cart but there is a glitch where item pictures do not display its image correctly. can add max of 3 items. 

clicking on "create account" links you to another .html file called "login-page.html" but does not work at the moment. "create account" to work needs a database, most common tools are used with XAMPP from what I have seen. 


The site has been created from scratch and added the swiping functinality (https://swiperjs.com) for "most popular" and "customer reviews". As well as size adaptability. when shrinking the site to phone screen size, an icon will appear to show the navigation bar such as menu, products, etc.
